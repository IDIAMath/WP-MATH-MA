# WP-MATH-MA

Goal of this WP is to set up 10 model problems from engineering math for interactiv 3D questions.

## Collection of Model problems
### Model problem 1

## Collection of ideas
### Quadratic forms
Given a quadratic form (genarated randomly) the student should figure out the numbers in the matrix A. The first draft is done using sage.
Two files are available.

### Parametrized surface

3d objects, how to describe surfaces
change coordinates: cartesian to polar.

### Parametrized curves
piecewise defined curves 

### line integrals
given a vectorfield and a curve
find parameters, where the integral will have a certain value.
