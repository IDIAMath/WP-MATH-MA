## Question description

A 3D volume is plotted. It is a randomly generated section of a ball in spherical coordinates.

The task is to find the correct intervalls for $r$, $\phi$ and $\psi$ in real numbers that construct the generated volume in sperical coordinates.


### Student perspective


The student sees a cartesian coordinate system and a volume with spherical geometry.

It is the task to reconstruct the intervals of a 3D integration in spherical coordinates that results in the volume given. In order to do this they have to find out the radius and angles by rotating the volume with the sliders. That way they can look at different projections of the volume and deduce the limits.

### Teacher perspective
The teacher is able to give a list of possible values for interval bounds. In order to do this, they simply need to modify the entries in the lists specified e.g. change `psiranger:rand([1/6,1/4,1/3,1/2,2/3])` to `psiranger:rand([1/8,1/7,1/3])`. However, if they change this, they have to make sure $\psi$, composed by `phistartr+phiranger` is not larger than 1, since it will be multiplied by $\pi$.

Another example - in the case of the radius - is the following: change `radius1:rand(6)/2` to `radius1: rand(8)/2` in order to select numbers from 0 to 4 in steps of 1/2.

For an explanation of the processing of the values read **Question variables** and **Question text**.

**It is important to make sure that $\psi \le \pi$ and $\phi \le 2 \pi$, when changing values!**

## Question code

### Question Variables
+	phiranger and phistartr take random values of a list containing possible values for phi (needs to be multiplied by pi later)
+	psiranger and psistartr take random values of a list containing possible values for phi (needs to be multiplied by pi later)
+	radius1 and radius2 are randomly selected in steps of 1/2 and radius2 is always bigger than radius1  
+	psiranger, phiranger, psistartr and phistartr are multiplied by pi and saved as numerical values. This is done in between `numer:true` and `numer:false`.

### Question Text
+	"Given is a 3D volume with spherical geometry. It is defined by the intervals for each of the spherical coordinates $r$, $\phi$ and $\psi$. Here $r$ is the radial coordinate and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle starting at the $x$-axis oriented counterclockwise with $\phi\in [0, 2 \pi]$. Lastly, $\psi$ is the polar angle measured from the $z$-axis with $\psi\in [0, \pi]$. 

	 The volume is contained in the interval between a smaller and a bigger value of the coordinates.

	 The point of view can be rotated with help of the sliders in the plot. </p>

	**Reconstruct the intervals that define the given volume.** 

	 Write the interval in the form $r\in$`[r1,r2]` and  $\phi\in$ `[phi1,phi2]`, e.g. `[1/2,2]` and `[1/2*pi,2*pi]`.
